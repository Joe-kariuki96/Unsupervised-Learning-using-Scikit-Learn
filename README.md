# Introduction

This report serves as an in-depth exploration of unsupervised learning algorithms using Scikit-learn, focusing on clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. By delving into clustering algorithms like K Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering, as well as dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), we aim to uncover patterns within data and reduce high-dimensional datasets to more manageable dimensions. Through practical examples and explanations, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of these techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.

# Methodology

The report begins with an introduction to unsupervised learning, outlining its significance in discovering patterns in data and reducing dimensionality. It then proceeds to discuss clustering algorithms, namely K Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering, elucidating their principles and real-world applications. Additionally, the report explores dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing the dimensions of datasets while preserving important information. Each algorithm is accompanied by practical examples using the Iris flower dataset, allowing readers to grasp their implementation and interpretation.

# Results

In the exploration of clustering algorithms, K Means demonstrated effective clustering of Iris flower species, while DBSCAN offered an alternative approach based on density. Hierarchical clustering provided insights into hierarchical relationships within the data. Moreover, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE successfully reduced the dimensions of the dataset, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in lower dimensions. Through visualizations and analyses, readers gained a deeper understanding of the clustering and dimensionality reduction processes, enhancing their ability to apply these techniques to their own datasets.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this report has provided a comprehensive overview of unsupervised learning algorithms, focusing on clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. By exploring various algorithms and their applications using the Iris flower dataset, readers have gained valuable insights into the principles and practical implementations of these techniques. Armed with this knowledge, they are better equipped to utilize unsupervised learning algorithms to discover patterns, reduce dimensionality, and derive meaningful insights from their data.
